## Table Definitions

### Worker Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE worker (
    worker_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name CHAR(25),
    last_name CHAR(25),
    salary INT(15),
    joining_date DATE,
    department CHAR(25)
);
````

### Bonus Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE bonus (
    worker_ref_id INT,
    bonus_amount INT,
    bonus_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (worker_ref_id) REFERENCES worker(worker_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
